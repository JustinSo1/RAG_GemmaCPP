While the context does not provide any specific information about web-based self-management strategies for chronic pain, it does suggest that self-management strategies may be beneficial for managing chronic pain.

Self-management strategies can include various techniques such as relaxation techniques, exercise, mindfulness, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. These strategies can help individuals with chronic pain to manage their symptoms, reduce their pain perception, and improve their quality of life.

Some examples of web-based self-management strategies for chronic pain include:

- Mindfulness meditation: This practice involves focusing on the present moment and reducing stress and anxiety.
- Progressive muscle relaxation: This technique involves tensing and relaxing different muscle groups in the body to relieve pain and tension.
- Yoga: This mind-body practice combines physical postures, breathing exercises, and meditation to promote relaxation and pain relief.
- Exercise: Regular exercise can help improve flexibility, strength, and endurance, which can reduce pain and improve overall quality of life.

It's important to note that web-based self-management strategies are not a substitute for professional medical care. If you're experiencing chronic pain, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options."
